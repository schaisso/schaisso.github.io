<h1>Things I'm Learning</h1>

<p>I intend for this page to be a blog of sorts, to keep track of the
coding topics I go over every few days. If I'm not careful to really learn a
topic, I find myself going back to it. Hopefully, recounting it in blog
style will help things to stick a little better, and may help someone along
their coding journey.

<h2>10/5/18: JavaScript Arrays</h2>

<p>After graduation, one of the first MeetUps I attended was a MeetUp for
<a href="http://codefordurham.com/">Code for Durham</a>, a civic hacking group.
I was super involved in civic engagement at UNC when I was getting my Bachelor's,
and I hope that in my second career I can be more involved in civic engagement
than my first career has allowed.

<p>Anyhow, I showed up and decided to volunteer with the Affordable Housing
group, as it was something I could see myself being interested in addressing.
Gentrification is becoming a huge concern in Durham, especially with the
construction of a light rail. One of the organizers asked me about my CS background,
and eventually we decided that commenting the existing code may be a good task
to get up to speed with how everything worked. However, in my post-Baccalaureate
program, we never used JavaScript or Python, which is what the project was
written in. I got a bit overwhelmed.

<p>A few days later, I found <a href="learn.co">The Flatiron School's Coding
Bootcamp Prep</a> that has an intro to web development course. I have gotten
through HTML, CSS, and am working on JS. Tonight, I worked with JS Arrays and
Objects! One benefit of having gone through my CS post-Baccalaureate program is
that I have a firm understanding of OOP, but Java and JS are completely different.

<p>Arrays are Objects that are ordered lists of elements separated by commas.
An array creation looks like:
<br>
<br>
var myArray = [element0, element1, ..., elementN];
<br>
<br>
or like:
<br>
<br>
var myArray = new Array();
<br>
<br>
The first array would look like:
<br>
<br>
var myArray = [
  'element0'
  'element1'
  ...
  'elementN'
]
<br>
<br>
<p>Arrays are ordered, and stay in the order they are created in. The array
[1, 2, 3] is different from the array [2, 1, 3]. Elements can be added to an
array directly at specific indices, but it's best not to, although accessing
them that way is okay. Adding elements directly inserts undefined into indices
not already used (ex: 1, 2, undefined, 4). Array indices are strings that can be
accessed by array-style notation using brackets, and any numbers used for an array
index will be coerced into strings. JS won't complain if you try to index an array
with a variable whose contents don't represent a number, and rather than adding an
index to the array, you'd add a property to that array, which is just a named
piece of information that we can only get with reference to the Object. Ex:
Array.length. In JS, we can assign properties to arrays. Ex: array.myProp = "I'm
a property"
<p>Some common array manipulations are:
<br>
<br>Mutators(change the underlying array):
<br>push: adds an element to the end of the array
<br>pop: removes an element from the end of the array
<br>unshift: adds an element to the beginning of the array
<br>shift: removes an element from the beginning of the array
<br>
<br>Non-destructive and tools(preserve the underlying array):
<br>spread operator: three dots in a row, spreads out the arrays contents, copies
the contents that are in the underlying array, can be used to make a new array to
manipulate.
<br>slice: takes a slice from the array. The first argument specifies start point,
second argument (if any) specifies end point. Passing a negative (-n) argument to
slice results in the last n elements in an array. Slice can be strategically used
to avoid mutating the array in ways that push/pop/unshift/shift would do.
<br>splice: useful in removing elements from the middle of an array. Splice takes
an index in the array as the first argument, the number of elements to remove as
the second, and any number of elements to add after the second. With no arguments,
splice returns an empty array and doesn't affect the target array.
