<p>I'm Sarah, and I'm a 27 year old in Raleigh, NC.
  I grew up in Randleman, NC, and moved to Chapel Hill for college.
  There, I studied Dental Hygiene, and graduated in 2009.
  I have since decided that I don't want to be a doctor, and
  went back to school for Computer Science.</p>

<p>I completed the Computer Science Certificate for Post-Baccalaureate
  students at NC State in August, 2018. I'm creating this website to learn
  some new skills, and to share some about myself that doesn't belong on a
  resume!</p>
